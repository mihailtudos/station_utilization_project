# station_utilization_project
This is an internal project intended to show available stations within an AR site. 

How it works:

- The web page will refresh every 1 min to show in real time station availability on building floors
- The tool will also show the type of station available (useful for pick and stow)


Benefits: 

- Reduced ToT (see it, take it)
- Allows to keep 2m social distancing as the AAs don’t need to approach a team lead or AM anymore to request a new station 
- Improved fast start (grab scanner, check available station, go)
- Improve availability and sustainability (no need for someone to be at the desk all day long just to issue a new station) therefore the management team could tackle more important aspects of the business 

At the moment the app supports the following FCs:

•	BRS1
•	EMA1 
•	MAN1 
•	MAN2
•	MAN3 
•	MME1 
•	MME2
